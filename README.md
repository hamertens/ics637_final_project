# ics637_final_project

This is the implementation for the final project in the ICS 637 Fall 2024 class by Hans Mertens. The repository contains code for both the old and the new environment. main.py will train a new agent, evaluate.py will evaluate an existing agent and with visualize.ipynb the trajectory of an evaluated agent can be displayed. In utils/gym_env all configurations of the gymnasium environment can be seen and modified.
